✅ Salesforce Test Data Generation Rules

📘 1. General Principles

Use realistic but anonymized data (e.g., "John Doe", "Acme Corp", "123 Main St")
Ensure data types match Salesforce field definitions (e.g., text, picklist, number, date)
Respect field validation rules, required fields, and formats
📌 2. Object-Specific Guidelines

🔹 Opportunities

Name: Combine customer + product + date (e.g., "Acme CRM Upgrade - Apr 2025")
Stage: Valid Salesforce stages (e.g., Prospecting, Qualification, Closed Won)
Close Date: Must be a valid future or current date
Amount: Positive currency format (e.g., 15000.00)
Account ID: Reference valid Account record
Owner: Valid Salesforce user ID
🔹 Accounts

Name: Unique and realistic company names
Type: Select from valid picklist (e.g., Customer - Direct, Partner)
Industry: Standard Salesforce industries (e.g., Technology, Finance)
🔹 Contacts

First & Last Name: Use realistic names
Email: Valid email format (e.g., john.doe@example.com)
Account Name: Reference an existing Account
🔹 Leads

Lead Source: Must be from allowed picklist (e.g., Web, Referral, Partner)
Status: New, Working, Converted
Company: Must be filled for Leads
Email/Phone: Valid formats
🧪 3. Negative Testing Data

Leave required fields blank to verify validations
Input invalid formats for emails, dates, currencies
Use unauthorized profiles for permission tests
🛡️ 4. Security & Compliance

Avoid using real customer data
Mask sensitive fields (e.g., SSN, credit card) in test environments
Use role-based visibility scenarios (e.g., profile permissions, record sharing)
🔄 5. Automation Friendly

Include unique identifiers or timestamps for easy cleanup
Data should be reusable across multiple test cases
Use consistent naming conventions
🧱 6. Dependencies

Ensure related objects are created in proper order (e.g., Account → Opportunity → Contact)
