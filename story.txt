The Golden Phone
Lily loved playing games on her phone. One day, she found a shiny golden phone in a small shop. The shopkeeper smiled and said,

"This phone is special. Anything you wish for will come true!"

Lily was excited! She made wishes:

"I want the best grades!" - The phone gave her perfect answers in school.

"I want to be the fastest runner!" - She won every race without training.

"I want to be famous!" - Everyone knew her name!

At first, Lily was happy. But soon, she noticed problems:

Her best friend Mia stopped studying. "You always win, so why should I try?" Mia said.

Her teacher looked sad. "No one is learning anymore," she sighed.

Lily got bored. Everything was too easy!

One day, the phone glowed red. The shopkeeper appeared and said,
"Youâ€™re taking the fun out of learning and trying! If you donâ€™t stop, all effort will disappear!"

Lily was scared. She stopped using the phone and started working hard instead. She studied with Mia, practiced running, and tried her best.

Slowly, the phone lost its magic, but Lily was happier than ever. She learned that real success comes from effort, not shortcuts!

Moral of the Story:
Hard work makes achievements special. Easy wins arenâ€™t fun! ðŸ˜Š
